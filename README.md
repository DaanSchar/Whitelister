# WhiteLister
A simple GUI tool to convert a list of Minecraft usernames to a whitelist.

## How to use
After downloading the binary (jar file), simply run it. 
You can either copy paste a list of names into the names field, or select a file (either csv or txt) which contain
the names of the players you would like to whitelist. if you are using a csv file, you need to specify the column name
which holds the names. (The name of the column is defined by the text in the first row of that column).
